# Introduction

The `metaboliteIDmapping` AnnotationHub package provides a
comprehensive ID mapping for various metabolite ID formats. Within
this annotation package, nine different ID formats and metabolite
common names are merged in one large mapping table. ID formats include
[Comptox Chemical Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard) IDs
(DTXCID, DTXSID), [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) IDs
(CID, SID), [CAS Registry
numbers](https://www.cas.org/support/documentation/references)
(CAS-RN), [Human Metabolome Database](https://hmdb.ca/) (HMDB),
[Chemical Entities of Biological
Interest](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) (ChEBI), [KEGG
Compounds](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/) (KEGG), and
[Drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca/) (Drugbank)

The metabolite IDs and names were retrieved from four different
publicly available sources and merged into one mapping table by means
of the R script that is distributed alongside the AnnotationHub
package. The script is located in `system.file( package =
"metaboliteIDmapping", "/scripts/make-data.R")`

A brief description of the utilized data sources is given in the following section.

# Data sources

Four publicly available sources were queried to retrieved nine different metabolite
ID formats. As short description of those sources is listed below:

## The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)

    * Website: https://hmdb.ca/
    * Current version: 4.0
    * Download link: https://hmdb.ca/system/downloads/current/hmdb_metabolites.zip
    * File format: XML
    * ID formats: HMDB, CAS, Pubchem CID, KEGG, ChEBi, Drugbank
    * Number of metabolites: 114100

## Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)

    * Website: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/
    * Current version: Jan 5, 2020
    * Download link: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chebi/Flat_file_tab_delimited/database_accession.tsv
    * File format: TSV
    * ID formats: ChEBI, CAS, KEGG
    * Number of metabolites: 17227


## Comptox Chemical Dashboard
 
    * Website: https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard
    * Comptox Chemical Dashboard supplied us with two separate files, 
    one linking to Pubchem IDs and other linking to CAS numbers.

### Linking to Pubchem
 
    * Download link: ftp://newftp.epa.gov/COMPTOX/Sustainable_Chemistry_Data/Chemistry_Dashboard/PubChem_DTXSID_mapping_file.txt
    * Current version: Nov 14, 2016
    * File format: TSV
    * ID formats: DTXSID, CID, SID
    * Number of metabolites: 735553

### Linking to CAS registry numbers
 
    * Download link: ftp://newftp.epa.gov/COMPTOX/Sustainable_Chemistry_Data/Chemistry_Dashboard/2019/April/DSSTox_Identifiers_and_CASRN.xlsx
    * Current version: Apr, 2019
    * File format: XLSX
    * ID formats: DTXCID, DTXSID, CAS
    * Number of metabolites: 875755

### Full-join on both tables based on DTXSID 

    * ID formats: DTXCID, DTXSID, CAS, CID, SID
    * Number of combined metabolites: 875796


## `graphite` R package

    * Website: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/graphite.html
    * Current Version: Bioconductor release 3.11
    * Data structure: date.frame
    * Access from R package: `graphite:::loadMetaboliteDb()@table`
    * ID formats: KEGG, ChEBI, CAS, Pubchem CID
    * Number of metabolites: 155651



# Usage

There are two different ways to load the mapping ID table from this package.

First, simply load the `metaboliteIDmapping` package into your R session.
When the package is loaded, the data will be available as tibble:

```{r load_library}

library( metaboliteIDmapping)

metabolitesMapping

```

Second, search for the mapping table in the AnnotationHub resource interface:

```{r search_mapping}

library( AnnotationHub)

ah <- AnnotationHub()
datasets <- query( ah, "metaboliteIDmapping")

datasets[1]

datasets[2]

```

Currently, there are two versions of the mapping table. 

* AH79817 represents the original ID mapping containing 9 different ID formats
* AH83115 is the current mapping table which also includes common names for each compound

For implanting this data in your code, it is recommended to use the
AHid for retrieval:
```{r load_mapping}

data <- ah[["AH83115"]]

data

```
